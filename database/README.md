# Mutualism Investments Project

## About Project Mutualism
* The purpose of Mutualism’s online portals is so people can access financial services and business growth tools. South Africa has thousands of SMMEs operating informally from book keeping, to management, to saving, and learning — we hope to offer an environment where that is made easy. 

* Our goal is to build a robust database of applicants (Verified ID, business plan, (financials if existing, location etc) that are looking to develop small businesses. With a healthy database of applicants (many hooked up to financials which we can view), we will be to serve as an intermediary (or fund) for the private sector to sustainably invest in Township SMMEs across SA & beyond.
