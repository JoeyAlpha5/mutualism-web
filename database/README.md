# Mutualism Investments Project
The goal of Mutualism's online portals is to allow individuals to access financial services and resources for business development. From bookkeeping, to management, to investing, and studying, South Africa has thousands of SMMEs working informally, and we aim to deliver an atmosphere where that is made convenient.
