# Mutualism Investments Project

## About Project Mutualism
* The purpose of Mutualism’s online portals is so people can access financial services and business growth tools. South Africa has thousands of SMMEs operating informally from book keeping, to management, to saving, and learning — we hope to offer an environment where that is made easy. 

* Our goal is to build a robust database of applicants (Verified ID, business plan, (financials if existing, location etc) that are looking to develop small businesses. With a healthy database of applicants (many hooked up to financials which we can view), we will be to serve as an intermediary (or fund) for the private sector to sustainably invest in Township SMMEs across SA & beyond.

## Analysis and Background

## UML Class Diagram
A unified modeling language (UML) is static diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the systems: classes, attributes, operations and the relationships among objects.

## Use Case Sets
Use cases are sets of actions, services, and functions that the system needs to perform. A use case set for a system is a tabular representation of the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved, it also shows the relationships that the use cases have with each other. 

## Entity Relational Diagram (ERD)
The entity relational diagram (ERD) shows a graphical presentation of database that depicts the relationships among actors (System users). The relationship between thee entities are linked using the primary and foreign keys.

## Data Disctinary Extract
The data dictionary shows set of data describing the scope, format, type, description and the relationship between the attributes. It is used to control access to and manipulation of the datastore.
